#### Gravity Apply
The gravity system applied in game was learning from 
[oliverholmberg](https://gist.github.com/oliverholmberg/de738361a07246991b56). 
I learned from his algorithm and modified to made it adopt to my game environment.

Bgms are made by [Jin](https://space.bilibili.com/4162287)'s(Jin is a great BILIBILIer) friend [WENGU HU](http://dgspitzer.my-style.in/gameportfolio/). He is a great artist.
