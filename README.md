#### Gravity Apply
The gravity apply in gameplay is learning from
[oliverholmberg](https://gist.github.com/oliverholmberg/de738361a07246991b56)
I learn from his Newton gravity formula algorithm and modified to adopt to my game environment

The bgms of the game are made by [Jin's](https://roshinichi.itch.io/) friend [WENGU HU](http://dgspitzer.my-style.in/gameportfolio/). He is a great artist.
